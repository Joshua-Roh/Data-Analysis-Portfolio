# Joshua Roh - Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi! I'm Josh. I'm a recent graduate from University of California, Santa Barbara and hold a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in Economics. I have 3 years of experience in the healthcare field however, after a year of transitioning from the field of healthcare to analytics, I have gained immense knowledge through the personal projects that you will find in this section. 

This repository serves to showcase my data analysis skills through these projects on this platform. It is also a way to track my progression in this field.
